# About the Indigo Project

Welcome back to the world of Pokémon !

As part of my portfolio, this project consists in a remake of the Indigo Plateau level from the first generation games.

The aim here is to reproduce a faithful and convincing game experience, adapting pre 2000's Game Boy graphic assets to a modern React Native application.
</br>

## Getting Started

This [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project was bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).  


### Step 1: Clone the repo and install dependencies

After cloning this repo, run the following command from the _root_ of the project to install dependencies:


```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

If you are running this project on an iPhone device/simulator, install the pods as well: 

```bash
# go to ios directory
cd ios

# install the pods
pod install
```
</br>

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```
</br>


## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
</br>

## Congratulations! :tada:
If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your the app running in your _Android or Apple device_ or _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run the app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

You should see a splash screen followed by a quick starting animation.

Press the Start button to begin, and enjoy! :partying_face:
